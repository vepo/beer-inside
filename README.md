# Beer Inside

Beer Inside is a temperature monitoring service for micro brewery deliveries.

## How it works

Every beer container has a internal sensor that sends every minute its temperature to our server. So, when it is time to make a delivery, the micro brewery can load the truck with all information (beers + container code) and just open our monitor to check if everything is ok!
